\title{Retrieving Bioconductor Annotation Maps}
\usage{
biocann_object(to, from = NULL, optional = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{to}{target annotation field as a character string, e.g., \dQuote{ENTREZID},
\dQuote{ENSEMBL}, or an annotation package or db which means that one wants to
retrieve a mapping to its corresponding primary identifier.
If \code{from} is missing, \code{to} must be the name of an annotation package,
i.e. ends with \dQuote{db}), in which case it tries loading the package and return
the whole annotation db object; or any annotation package db or map object such as
\code{AnnDbBimap}, \code{ChipDb} or \code{OrgDb} objects, which are returned unchanged.}

\item{from}{source annotation package as a character string e.g. \code{"hgu133a.db"}.}

\item{optional}{logical that indicates if the function should return \code{NULL} if the
mapping cannot be found (\code{TRUE}), or throw an error.
Note that this does not apply to the installation part: if a required annotation
package is missing, an error is thrown even if \code{optional=TRUE}.}
}
\value{
a \code{\link{ProbeAnnDbBimap}} if annotation is not missing,
a \code{ProbeAnnDb} object otherwise.
}
\description{
The function \code{biocann_object} retrieves annotation objects, like bimaps, from
Bioconductor annotation packages.
It is similar to the function \code{getAnnMap} from the \pkg{annotate} package,
except that it also accepts annotation -- bimap -- objects,
and will try to install missing packages if not found (see section Details).
}
\details{
If an annotation package is specified as a character string, and is not found in the
search path, and if R runs in interactive mode, then the user is asked whether one
should try install the missing package.
Default response is 'yes' so that simply hitting return will install the package
via \code{\link{install.packages}} and load it.
An error is thrown if this eventually fails.

\examples{

# db package object
biocann_object('hgu133plus2.db')

# bimap from hgu133plus2 probe id to ENTREZID 
biocann_object('ENTREZID', 'hgu133plus2.db')

# reversed bimap from UNIGENE to hgu133plus2 probe id
biocann_object('hgu133plus2.db', 'UNIGENE')
# this is equivalent to using the annotation package object (no quotes),
# when the package is already loaded (=> helpful in interactive session with auto-completion)
biocann_object(hgu133plus2.db, 'UNIGENE')

}
